# Global Significant Earthquake Analysis

The Significant Earthquake Database is a global listing of over 5,700 earthquakes from 2150 BC to the present.
A significant earthquake is classified as one that meets at least one of the following criteria: caused deaths, caused moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami. The database provides information on the date and time of occurrence, latitude and longitude, focal depth, magnitude, maximum MMI intensity, and socio-economic data such as the total number of casualties, injuries, houses destroyed, and houses damaged, and $ dollage damage estimates. References, political geography, and additional comments are also provided for each earthquake. If the earthquake was associated with a tsunami or volcanic eruption, it is flagged and linked to the related tsunami event or significant volcanic eruption.

## Our Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle. "Global Significant Earthquake Database from 2150BC" "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohitkr05/global-significant-earthquake-database-from-2150bc"



This repository contains Python code for analysing a worldwide earthquake database. The dataset provides information about significant earthquakes, including their magnitudes, locations, and temporal patterns.

# In this project, we will check
### Q1. Where are the earthquakes? Are they located on the Pacific Ring of Fire? 
### Q2. When do earthquakes occur? Investigating the number of earthquake trends over time
### Q3. How often do earthquakes trigger tsunamis?
### Q4. What is the correlation between Magnitude and Intensity?
# Analysis and Results

The analysis provides valuable insights into earthquake patterns, intensity distribution, and trends over time. Explore the generated plots and maps to gain a comprehensive understanding of seismic activity worldwide.
