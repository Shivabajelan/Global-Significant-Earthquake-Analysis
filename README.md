# Worldwide Earthquake Database Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analysing a worldwide earthquake database. The dataset provides information about significant earthquakes, including their magnitudes, locations, and temporal patterns.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python packages (matplotlib, pandas, numpy, hvplot, geoviews, geopandas, scipy, seaborn, folium)

## Our Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle. "Global Significant Earthquake Database from 2150BC" 

Download the Worldwide-Earthquake-database.csv file and place it in the "Resources" folder.

# In this project, we will check
### Q1. Where are the earthquakes? Are they located on the Pacific Ring of Fire? 
### Q2. When do earthquakes occur? Investigating the number of earthquake trends over time
### Q3. How often do earthquakes trigger tsunamis?
### Q4. What is the correlation between Magnitude and Intensity?

# Analysis and Results

The analysis provides valuable insights into earthquake patterns, intensity distribution, and trends over time. Explore the generated plots and maps to gain a comprehensive understanding of seismic activity worldwide.
